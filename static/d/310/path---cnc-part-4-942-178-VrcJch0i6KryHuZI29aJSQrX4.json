{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My first departure was a learning experience but is over. The cost of good motors and the gecko controller call for a machine with commensurate capabilities to be worthwhile. Fine Line Automation offers a popular kit called FLA-100 and posts free plans for the machine on their website. I decided to save for the entire kit and electronics. Then ABC Electronics got in a good load of 80/20 and my willpower gave out. A little at a time, my FLA-100 clone begins. <a href=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04081\" title=\"dsc04081\"></a></p>\n<p>This is a cheap sacrificial multipurpose blade. Very slow and steadied feeds gave an acceptable finish even without lube. I sprayed WD40 continuously to trim the more important lengths and got a nicer finish than I expected with the Craftsman.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dsc04080-a03fa14b58a6ae745962dca3e825e138.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04080-a03fa14b58a6ae745962dca3e825e138.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04080\" title=\"dsc04080\"></a></p>\n<p>There is a considerable amount of tapping involved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dsc04082-5312ea48fa7d0463a1df5510ed3a66e8.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04082-5312ea48fa7d0463a1df5510ed3a66e8.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04082\" title=\"dsc04082\"></a></p>\n<p>Here are the parts for the base and leftover bits. I realized after buying that this 80/20 is metric 40mm-based instead of 1-1/2\" per the plan. I ordered 2-1/2\" 1018 rails from DiscountSteel.com to drill myself so that the overhang is 1/2\" for the carriages from CNCRouterParts.com. Luckily, everything else works out if I switch to 1-1/2\"-based 80/20 from the carriages on.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_4","title":"CNC Part 4","date":"2011-05-18","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<h3>Failed downloads:</h3>\n<h3>Failed hexagons:</h3>\n<h3>Hexagons images:</h3>\n<p> <img src=\"/dsc04081.jpg_hexagon-f4be1a06ec14e163a7781a75401214e8.jpeg\" alt=\"dsc04081.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/dsc04080.jpg_hexagon-1ad02463d1fb8b42f0b3a16f16f1a51b.jpeg\" alt=\"dsc04080.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/dsc04082.jpg_hexagon-ff0dd2081625c6a20a7a19fbded61ec2.jpeg\" alt=\"dsc04082.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\"></p>","id":"6b38fb22-6917-50ba-acfe-5679a0a26225","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_4_images","title":"CNC Part 4 (images)","date":"2011-05-18","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":null}},"next":{"html":"<h3>Failed downloads:</h3>\n<h3>Failed hexagons:</h3>\n<h3>Hexagons images:</h3>\n<p> <img src=\"/img134.jpg_hexagon-06b27d757e29673859e86669feff7365.jpeg\" alt=\"img134.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/img1361.jpg_hexagon-9c2f44a6a23fda0e8b87b8a2551750e3.jpeg\" alt=\"img1361.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/img135.jpg_hexagon-afecc4df4549f654409643797c78b8e9.jpeg\" alt=\"img135.jpg_hexagon.jpeg\"></p>","id":"58861715-6821-5a7d-8082-e4ca75282150","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_5_images","title":"CNC Part 5 (images)","date":"2011-05-21","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":null}}}}
