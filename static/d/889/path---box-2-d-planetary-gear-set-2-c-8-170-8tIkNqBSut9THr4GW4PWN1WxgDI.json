A little trigonometry and fidgeting with sizes produced this simple planetary set:</p>\n<!-- swfobject.embedSWF(\"http://www.beigerecords.com/joe/sites/default/files/plexpinballmodule.swf\", \"planetary\", \"400\", \"400\", \"9.0.0\"); // -->\n<p>I quickly modified my sprocket construction code to make the annulus and spent a while scratching my head before remembering that the shape vertices have to be defined clockwise. Once they were, everything was interacting. But in all honesty, I have to nudge the annulus to get it going no matter how much torque I apply to the sun gear. It would be great to understand why if you know. And it would be really cool to develop an \"eccentric drive\" or two like these:</p>\n<embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QP5LN9jcsz4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\">  \n<embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8dR38uQN74c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\">  \nand eventually...  \n<embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/pHO1JTNPPOU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\">","frontmatter":{"path":"/box2d_planetary_gear_set","title":"Box2D Planetary Gear Set","date":"2009-09-17","tags":["physics","programming"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
