{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A recent hobby has been to build and install a solar panel on our roof. It's comprised of 36 common Evergreen Solar 3\"x6\" 1.8W cells in a simple wooden frame with a sheet of acrylic to protect them. My Dad helped run conduit and wires last weekend and the open source hardware/software available these days makes it unbelievably easy to setup a voltage logging apparatus. A 10k then a 2.2k resistor straddle the wires coming into our basement from the panel. The junction of those is connected to an analog input on an <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMini\">Arduino Mini</a> . Every minute, the Atmega reports the value read at that input to the serial port. A simple processing sketch receives the value and makes an HTTP request to my web host, which stores the value in a database. <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/flot/\">The \"Flot\" plugin for jQuery</a> makes rendering a nice line-graph of the incoming data straightforward. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/solar_day_one-f9ec32d0aa3cbf50309a3f0fe61ac825.jpg\"><img src=\"/solar_day_one-f9ec32d0aa3cbf50309a3f0fe61ac825.jpg\" alt=\"Day One Voltages From Solar Panel\" title=\"solar_day_one\"></a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/solar_panel","title":"Solar Panel","date":"2010-07-27","tags":["arduino","electronics","house","solar"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<p>I copied the design for this box joint jig from the great <a href=\"http://woodgears.ca/\">http://woodgears.ca/</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/dscf1114-1bc51d568ccd28f226f33a1bb0b6faa9.jpg\"><img src=\"/dscf1114-1bc51d568ccd28f226f33a1bb0b6faa9.jpg\" alt=\"dscf1114\" title=\"dscf1114\"></a> </p>\n<p>The carriage and rails use maple for the sliding parts.
