{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The most satisfying thing a monkey can do is use his own handmade tools. And, I spent a lot of time cleaning up the first seven tenons with just a chisel. So, I made this new shoulder/chisel plane after reading about <a href=\"http://garagewoodworks.com/garage_blog/2010/11/29/chisel-plane-2-0/\">the one on garagewoodworks.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04449_0-9c4537d7bdf2ffcda71e8a9eb1729461.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04449_0-9c4537d7bdf2ffcda71e8a9eb1729461.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>It was faster to cnc my bed and then route the opposing rabbet than it would have been to glue a separate piece on the side. I randomly drew a hump on the top front of the plane which reminds me to steady the plane there while I push from the back. If I don't hold the front, the plane doesn't stay level or work very well. But it's very clean and effective when used carefully.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04450-0709f0a52d38a8e67c5703aecb43423f.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04450-0709f0a52d38a8e67c5703aecb43423f.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here, I'm taking the cheek down to the marking knife line. This was the bottom of the bandsaw's kerf - pretty far from the line. It wandered partly because of traveling through 120mm of 100-plus-year-old oak or partly because I sharpen the bandsaw blade unevenly with my right hand. I'm happy that it didn't wander the other way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04451-2994a1e372012c309a58155151c33cb4.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04451-2994a1e372012c309a58155151c33cb4.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Then, a few swipes with this old smoothing plane will bring the whole cheek to width. This is the last tenon in the workbench base!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04452-4ed7e7004dab5fdf0579c41da37916fd.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04452-4ed7e7004dab5fdf0579c41da37916fd.jpg\"></a> </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/workbench_part_4","title":"Workbench Part 4","date":"2012-07-12","tags":["house"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<h3>Failed downloads:</h3>\n<h3>Failed hexagons:</h3>\n<h3>Hexagons images:</h3>\n<p> <img src=\"/DSC04449_0.JPG_hexagon-9d8dd2032ca872825ddf2ea5942e6959.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC04449_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/DSC04450.JPG_hexagon-86f7de61ab172139a1627e300696415e.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC04450.JPG_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/DSC04451.JPG_hexagon-734b5ba800dabc0cd3b4899d53920301.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC04451.JPG_hexagon.jpeg\">\n<img src=\"/DSC04452.JPG_hexagon-7754a8d46208874ac4049877c6b5f600.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC04452.JPG_hexagon.jpeg\"></p>","id":"f8510acd-7b6a-50af-a51b-15a5a800c46c","frontmatter":{"path":"/workbench_part_4_images","title":"Workbench Part 4 (images)","date":"2012-07-12","tags":["house"],"hexagonImages":null}},"next":{"html":"<h3>Failed downloads:</h3>\n<h3>Failed hexagons:</h3>\n<h3>Hexagons images:</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04458.JPG_hexagon-a4504aa1d86d7b3fe36990149fe74dce.jpeg\" alt=\"DSC04458.JPG_hexagon.jpeg\"></p>","id":"87212bb4-4a4e-5a49-b121-02d8329d7d6f","frontmatter":{"path":"/workbench_part_5_images","title":"Workbench Part 5 (images)","date":"2012-07-19","tags":["artwork","house"],"hexagonImages":null}}}}
