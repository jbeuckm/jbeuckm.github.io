I can't show any of the visualizations for privacy of the bank customers. But, working with the vast dataset presented a need to categorize bank customers by highly-dimensional demographic data. I implemented the basic K-Means algorithm with Javascript. With around ten thousand vectors to categorize, this algorithm was performant enough not to be sluggish in Javascript. If you have HD data to categorize, please check out the code and report issues or comments.</p>\n<p>Demo: <a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/jbeuckm/5731501\">http://bl.ocks.org/jbeuckm/5731501</a></p>\n<p>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/jbeuckm/K-Means\">https://github.com/jbeuckm/K-Means</a></p>","id":"173bbac3-b35d-5805-ab5b-c581dd41eee7","frontmatter":{"path":"/k_means_in_js","title":"K-Means In JS","date":"2013-06-28","tags":["ai","artwork","mathematics","programming"],"hexagonImages":["kmeans.png_hexagon.png"]}},"next":{"html":"<h3>Failed downloads:</h3>\n<h3>Failed hexagons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.beigerecords.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/k-means.zip\">http://www.beigerecords.com/joe/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/k-means.zip</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Hexagons images:</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/kmeans.png_hexagon-f56cf3243cbd664b4f6bcc9ba1e1ea1e.png\" alt=\"kmeans.png_hexagon.png\"></p>","id":"336808d7-2065-5645-987d-d16f17681076","frontmatter":{"path":"/k_means_clustering_code_images","title":"K-Means Clustering Code (images)","date":"2009-12-24","tags":["ai","artwork","mathematics","programming"],"hexagonImages":null}}}}
