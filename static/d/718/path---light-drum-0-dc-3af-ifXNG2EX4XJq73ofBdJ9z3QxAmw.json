Now I've been working with PIC16f84 chips and realized I could do it pretty easily.</p>\n<p>This prototype had two light-pads that sent midi successfully.</p>\n<p>The next step will be to make one with 8 pads and build a usable model to see if that's enough or if I want to multiplex and have 16 or more pads.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/light_drum","title":"Light Drum","date":"2003-04-06","tags":["midi"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
