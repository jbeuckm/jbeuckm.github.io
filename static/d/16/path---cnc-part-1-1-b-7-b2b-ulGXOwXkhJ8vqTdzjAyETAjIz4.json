{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I started building a CNC mill this weekend using a lot of the ideas from Tom McWire's popular instructible: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/\">http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"/z-axis_support-3f951dcea2bae5ec48e3fd2f7f219b32.jpg\"><img src=\"/z-axis_support-3f951dcea2bae5ec48e3fd2f7f219b32.jpg\" alt=\"z-axis_support\" title=\"z-axis_support\"></a> </p>\n<p>The z-axis support is 6\" x 1.25\" lumber that is box jointed. This is an extremely rigid assembly. The leveling feet probably aren't necessary but they were 35 cents at <a href=\"http://ax-man.com/\">Ax-man</a> and a bit classy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/x-axis-15dd84adf1fe108c1ee4dea9f4cf83c6.jpg\"><img src=\"/x-axis-15dd84adf1fe108c1ee4dea9f4cf83c6.jpg\" alt=\"x-axis\" title=\"x-axis\"></a> </p>\n<p>Here is my acrylic x-axis with aluminum channels, built on a piece of MDF. Menards didn't have ball bearings of the correct size so I'm trying a small, nylon shower curtain roller that is handily threaded. It turns easily with very little play and I can't imagine much difference between this and a ball bearing for this application. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/coupling_nuts-41050a5cd9ee89d31d669ba9253bb466.jpg\"><img src=\"/coupling_nuts-41050a5cd9ee89d31d669ba9253bb466.jpg\" alt=\"coupling_nuts\" title=\"coupling_nuts\"></a> </p>\n<p>Here are aluminum-wrapped coupling nuts for the three axes. Using long couplers instead of shorter tee-nuts is a great idea from the Tom. Also a great idea is using tubing to connect the stepper motor shaft to the threaded rod. I've been looking for a good way to make that joint for a while now and this is perfect. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_1","title":"CNC Part 1","date":"2010-11-15","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
