I tried to pile more batter into the head part but the the nose still came out partially empty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/half_out-17a0fe2d7410ae41e8e65e18720d6590.jpg\"><img src=\"/half_out-17a0fe2d7410ae41e8e65e18720d6590.jpg\" alt=\"half_out\" title=\"half_out\"></a></p>\n<p>Louisa is some kind of lamb cake mold extraction genius.
