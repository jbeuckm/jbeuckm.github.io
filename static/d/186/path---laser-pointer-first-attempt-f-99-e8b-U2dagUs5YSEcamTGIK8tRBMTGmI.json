And, the azimuth structure is massive enough to cause a lot of bounce when it starts/stops. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/side-af9287d27fb6765ceb9e5e02ef539dfa.jpg\"><img src=\"/side-af9287d27fb6765ceb9e5e02ef539dfa.jpg\" alt=\"side\" title=\"side\"></a> </p>\n<p>The rubber timing belts also contributed to the bounce. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/close_motor_driver-ce5f9d9e0571b59b42c335b758f8fc50.jpg\"><img src=\"/close_motor_driver-ce5f9d9e0571b59b42c335b758f8fc50.jpg\" alt=\"close_motor_driver\" title=\"close_motor_driver\"></a> </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the position was not repeatable. So, I'm working on a new prototype that will swivel on a lazy susan bearing and elevate across a sturdy hinge. The stepper motors will be joined to threaded rods which thread into t-nuts attached to the moveable parts. No play and no bounce should provide for positional repeatability. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/help-c4a33e1677040ccc8a84510782a7cb5a.jpg\"><img src=\"/help-c4a33e1677040ccc8a84510782a7cb5a.jpg\" alt=\"help\" title=\"help\"></a> </p>\n<p>And this time I have very good help. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/laser_pointer_first_attempt","title":"Laser Pointer First Attempt","date":"2009-08-21","tags":["arduino","artwork","laser"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
