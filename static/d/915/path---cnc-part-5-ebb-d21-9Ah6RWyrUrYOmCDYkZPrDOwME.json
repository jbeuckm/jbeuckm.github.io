{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"http://discountsteel.com\">DiscountSteel.com</a> had my rails cut and ready within 24 hours and I picked them up at lunch. Carefully scratched 32.7mm from the good edge with a woodscrew about every 4in. Then a tap with the transfer punch, check, and a good hit with the transfer punch. I drilled 1/8\" pilot holes and then 21/64\" for a close fit on the 5/16\" carriage bolts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\"><img src=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\" alt=\"img134\" title=\"img134\"></a> </p>\n<p>My rails are 2-1/2\" and hang inside a little. 20 minutes on the grinder per notch. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\"><img src=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\" alt=\"img1361\" title=\"img1361\"></a> </p>\n<p>They fit! This feels like real progress. The base is square and tight and the last metric vs. standard issue to correct will be the X-axis motor mount. Everything else (bearing blocks, acme nut) is referenced from the bottom surface of the 8020. I added a sideways length of my 40x80mm 80/20 between the front table side and the 14\" extension so that the front 1-1/2\" separated bearing block holes will fit. I sacrifice the lengthwise adjustment for that but can work out that difference with the grinder. All X and Y-aligned pieces will be a few millimeters longer than the plan due to the difference between 80mm and 3in. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\"><img src=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\" alt=\"img135\" title=\"img135\"></a> </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_5","title":"CNC Part 5","date":"2011-05-21","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
