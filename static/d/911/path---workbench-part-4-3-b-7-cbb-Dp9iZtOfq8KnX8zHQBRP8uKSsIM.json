{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The most satisfying thing a monkey can do is use his own handmade tools. And, I spent a lot of time cleaning up the first seven tenons with just a chisel. So, I made this new shoulder/chisel plane after reading about <a href=\"http://garagewoodworks.com/garage_blog/2010/11/29/chisel-plane-2-0/\">the one on garagewoodworks.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04449_0-9c4537d7bdf2ffcda71e8a9eb1729461.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04449_0-9c4537d7bdf2ffcda71e8a9eb1729461.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>It was faster to cnc my bed and then route the opposing rabbet than it would have been to glue a separate piece on the side. I randomly drew a hump on the top front of the plane which reminds me to steady the plane there while I push from the back. If I don't hold the front, the plane doesn't stay level or work very well. But it's very clean and effective when used carefully.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04450-0709f0a52d38a8e67c5703aecb43423f.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04450-0709f0a52d38a8e67c5703aecb43423f.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here, I'm taking the cheek down to the marking knife line. This was the bottom of the bandsaw's kerf - pretty far from the line. It wandered partly because of traveling through 120mm of 100-plus-year-old oak or partly because I sharpen the bandsaw blade unevenly with my right hand. I'm happy that it didn't wander the other way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04451-2994a1e372012c309a58155151c33cb4.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04451-2994a1e372012c309a58155151c33cb4.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Then, a few swipes with this old smoothing plane will bring the whole cheek to width. This is the last tenon in the workbench base!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04452-4ed7e7004dab5fdf0579c41da37916fd.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04452-4ed7e7004dab5fdf0579c41da37916fd.jpg\"></a> </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/workbench_part_4","title":"Workbench Part 4","date":"2012-07-12","tags":["house"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
