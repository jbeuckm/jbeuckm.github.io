{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This code draws a Mandelbrot pattern on the 132x132 Nokia 6100 type screen with Epson controller (will not work for the Phillips) from an <a href=\"http://arduino.cc\">Arduino</a>. I started with the code example from <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1237036119/45\">this post</a> and made some optimizations- especially to the serial communication code. Then I ported the Mandelbrot algorithm from <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/mandelbrot_obfuscation.aspx\">here</a>. The zoom level and viewport into the fractal can easily be changed or made to update each loop.

I still haven't been able to engage the 8-bit color mode, which would again speed things up since I could send one byte per pixel instead of three bytes for two pixels. I used an 8Mhz and would only use 16Mhz or higher setup if I did this again. When will there be a 2Ghz Arduino?
