To cut this pattern, the machine has to make thousands of movements staying within a few hundredths accurate. I tried cutting one for my parents' xmas present from some nice brazilian cherry. I joined two planks to get the required 16\" width, flattened the top and sprayed a light coat of polyurethane to help avoid chipping during the lighter detail passes. Next time I would apply a thick layer of poly since a few detailed places show some chipping.</p>\n<p>These were taken about an hour in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04195_0-99f66e6bac911dd6e235e3c4debbd724.jpg\"> <img src=\"/DSC04197_0-d3138a0fcd644121e91e0ad4b88d5675.jpg\"> <img src=\"/DSC04198_0-7b8b0646537399a24cdc55ddb82987ba.jpg\"></p>\n<p>lots of burrs to clean up by hand...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04199_0-3f0ed244a04701c3079f185398f0799f.jpg\"></p>\n<p>around two hours...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04202_0-9724e1142a5bbc1945192557d1dc96a5.jpg\"></p>\n<p>It took about three hours but came out very well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04204-59ef014a333a3a33d60a69f621c4269b.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I carefully added a circle about 1/4\" outside the pattern to cut the calendar from the stock.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04208_0-7f34c87032b9daa968283a1e494e684a.jpg\"></p>\n<p>ready for cleanup and a few light coats of poly</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04212_0-e87c2bb6a348f926778fd916422f85cf.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I think they liked it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSCN7390-0ba2fce49776c6ba458c47652d38f7be.jpeg\"> </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_15_aztec_calendar","title":"CNC Part 15: Aztec Calendar","date":"2012-01-01","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
