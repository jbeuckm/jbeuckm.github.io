{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My first departure was a learning experience but is over. The cost of good motors and the gecko controller call for a machine with commensurate capabilities to be worthwhile. Fine Line Automation offers a popular kit called FLA-100 and posts free plans for the machine on their website. I decided to save for the entire kit and electronics. Then ABC Electronics got in a good load of 80/20 and my willpower gave out. A little at a time, my FLA-100 clone begins. <a href=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04081\" title=\"dsc04081\"></a></p>\n<p>This is a cheap sacrificial multipurpose blade. Very slow and steadied feeds gave an acceptable finish even without lube. I sprayed WD40 continuously to trim the more important lengths and got a nicer finish than I expected with the Craftsman.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dsc04080-a03fa14b58a6ae745962dca3e825e138.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04080-a03fa14b58a6ae745962dca3e825e138.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04080\" title=\"dsc04080\"></a></p>\n<p>There is a considerable amount of tapping involved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dsc04082-5312ea48fa7d0463a1df5510ed3a66e8.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04082-5312ea48fa7d0463a1df5510ed3a66e8.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04082\" title=\"dsc04082\"></a></p>\n<p>Here are the parts for the base and leftover bits. I realized after buying that this 80/20 is metric 40mm-based instead of 1-1/2\" per the plan. I ordered 2-1/2\" 1018 rails from DiscountSteel.com to drill myself so that the overhang is 1/2\" for the carriages from CNCRouterParts.com. Luckily, everything else works out if I switch to 1-1/2\"-based 80/20 from the carriages on.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_4","title":"CNC Part 4","date":"2011-05-18","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
