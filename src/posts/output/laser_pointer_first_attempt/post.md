 [![](full1.jpeg)](full1.jpeg)

Here is a prototype two-axis pointing device designed to aim a laser diode's beam. It operates via USB to Arduino with my modified Firmata and AS3 Glue code and two EasyDriver stepper motor controller boards. [![full1](full1-768x1024.jpg "full1")](full1.jpg) This design is movable over virtually the entire sphere but it's difficult to build a well-aligned bearing and gear or pulley system. And, the azimuth structure is massive enough to cause a lot of bounce when it starts/stops. [![side](side-1024x768.jpg "side")](side.jpg) The rubber timing belts also contributed to the bounce. [![close_motor_driver](close_motor_driver-1024x768.jpg "close_motor_driver")](close_motor_driver.jpg) Ultimately, the position was not repeatable. So, I'm working on a new prototype that will swivel on a lazy susan bearing and elevate across a sturdy hinge. The stepper motors will be joined to threaded rods which thread into t-nuts attached to the moveable parts. No play and no bounce should provide for positional repeatability. [![help](help-768x1024.jpg "help")](help.jpg) And this time I have very good help. 10
