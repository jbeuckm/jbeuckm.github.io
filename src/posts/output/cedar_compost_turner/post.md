We accumulated a lot of compost quickly since moving into our house and it's become time to do something about it. This unwieldy barrel got designed on the fly but I think it will work. circle traced from inverted trash can [![circle traced from inverted trach can](circles_marked-300x225.jpg "circles_marked")](circles_marked.jpg) end parts joined with dowels [![end parts joined with dowels](end_pegs-300x225.jpg "end_pegs")](end_pegs.jpg) [![circles](circles-300x225.jpg "circles")](circles.jpg) modified radial saw for increased ripping safety. twenty-four 4" lengths of 2x4 got beveled to eight degrees on each side.
