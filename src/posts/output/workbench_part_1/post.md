 [![](DSC04414.JPG)](DSC04414.JPG)

Last winter, a very generous friend of a friend let us haul away a truckload of old oak timbers.

![](DSC04412.JPG)

The timbers came in a few lengths all over 1m and with varying conditions at the ends. Some had fancy looking old joinery that was still viable and some were decomposed.

A little TLC revealed lots of very usable oak. These will be the legs of my new workbench.

I cobbled together a new mallet from the scraps in anticipation of the joinery that will be required to finish the workbench
