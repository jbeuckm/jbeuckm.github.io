I started building a CNC mill this weekend using a lot of the ideas from Tom McWire's popular instructible: [http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/](http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/) [![z-axis_support](z-axis_support-300x225.jpg "z-axis_support")](z-axis_support.jpg) ThI started building a CNC mill this weekend using a lot of the ideas from Tom McWire's popular instructible: [http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/](http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/) [![z-axis_support](z-axis_support-300x225.jpg "z-axis_support")](z-axis_support.jpg) The z-axis support is 6" x 1.25" lumber that is box jointed. This is an extremely rigid assembly. The leveling feet probably aren't necessary but they were 35 cents at [Ax-man](http://ax-man.com/) and a bit classy. [![x-axis](x-axis-300x225.jpg "x-axis")](x-axis.jpg) Here is my acrylic x-axis with aluminum channels, built on a piece of MDF. Menards didn't have ball bearings of the correct size so I'm trying a small, nylon shower curtain roller that is handily threaded. It turns easily with very little play and I can't imagine much difference between this and a ball bearing for this application. [![coupling_nuts](coupling_nuts-300x225.jpg "coupling_nuts")](coupling_nuts.jpg) Here are aluminum-wrapped coupling nuts for the three axes. Using long couplers instead of shorter tee-nuts is a great idea from the Tom. Also a great idea is using tubing to connect the stepper motor shaft to the threaded rod. I've been looking for a good way to make that joint for a while now and this is perfect. 16
