Grandma Beuckman made a lamb cake every Easter growing up, so I laughed a bit when Lauren's mom produced their iron lamb cake mold. She gave it to Lauren (wizard of desserts) to try this year and I think we restarted their tradition today. An attempt yesterday afternoon failed miserably so I decided to document today's go in case we got it right. And we did, somewhat. \[caption id="attachment\_304" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="All criscoed up and floured"\] [![All criscoed up and floured](dsc03477-300x225.jpg "dsc03477")](dsc03477.jpg) \[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_300" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Batter up."\] [![Batter up.](dsc03478-300x225.jpg "dsc03478")](dsc03478.jpg) \[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_306" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="No face?
