[DiscountSteel.com](http://discountsteel.com) had my rails cut and ready within 24 hours and I picked them up at lunch. Carefully scratched 32.7mm from the good edge with a woodscrew about every 4in. Then a tap with the transfer punch, check, and a good hit with the transfer punch. I drilled 1/8" pilot holes and then 21/64" for a close fit on the 5/16" carriage bolts. [![img134](img134-300x225.jpg "img134")](img134.jpg) My rails are 2-1/2" and hang inside a little. 20 minutes on the grinder per notch. [![img1361](img1361-300x225.jpg "img1361")](img1361.jpg) They fit! This feels like real progress. The base is square and tight and the last metric vs. standard issue to correct will be the X-axis motor mount. Everything else (bearing blocks, acme nut) is referenced from the bottom surface of the 8020. I added a sideways length of my 40x80mm 80/20 between the front table side and the 14" extension so that the front 1-1/2" separated bearing block holes will fit. I sacrifice the lengthwise adjustment for that but can work out that difference with the grinder. All X and Y-aligned pieces will be a few millimeters longer than the plan due to the difference between 80mm and 3in. [![img135](img135-225x300.jpg "img135")](img135.jpg) 10
