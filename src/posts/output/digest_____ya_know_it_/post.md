Lots of folks like to listen to Bobby Brown's Dance! ...Ya Know It! (especially the raps and breakdowns) very frequently. Eagerly awaiting the next breakdown 1/14/03 and making myself late for work, I realized a need for a condensed version of Dance! ...Ya Know It! for times when complete songs are not the priority or our busy lifestyles just won't afford us the whole 47:29. I've been able to compile the major raps and breakdowns from Dance! ...Ya Know It! into 628 seconds available in the mp3 file that follows:

<audio controls="controls" preload="auto" autobuffer="autobuffer" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><source src="digest_ya_know_it.mp3"></audio>
