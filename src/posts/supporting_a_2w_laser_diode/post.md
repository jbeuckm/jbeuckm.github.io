Left to Right:
--------------

*   Monster transformer from Mexico
*   Monster capacitor from Japan
*   Monster rectifier
*   High current 12V power supply ([schematic](http://www.elecfree.com/circuit/power-supply/12-volt-30-amp-by-7812/))
*   Classroom style ammeter (YES, 2.3AMPS!!!)
*   Constant-current driver circuit ([schematic](http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserdps.htm#dpsccs))
*   2W laser diode w/TEC on a big heatsink
Below that diode: **The faint red glow of 808nm love**

### Notes:

*   The thicker pair of wires on the transformer are the output - not mains. I found this out by tripping the circuit breaker a couple times. It's so nice having a house!
*   Plugging this thing in caused a spark in the mains connection, which failed after a few seconds making me fear the worst for the laser. Turns out my soldering iron is not hot enough to bond to the heavy steel connectors so I hit them with a hammer to make them touch the cables. Works great.
*   This is the first circuit I've built where the fan really is necessary. The far transistor on the power supply tends to heat up and lose current without the fan.
*   This nice diode has a TEC right in the case, so I am just running that series with the diode from the driver circuit.

Big shouts going out to [ABC Electronics](http://www.abcelectronicsmn.com/), [Ax-Man](http://ax-man.com/) and especially [heruursciences](http://laserpointerforums.com/f55/red-808nm-1-5-watt-laser-diodes-more-cheap-39834.html).
