The rest of my 80/20 arrived at John Henry Foster and I picked it up. The X-axis is aligned and slides easily and smoothly by hand. So I tightened down the acme nut and bearing blocks at each end and chucked an inch of 1/4" rod in my drill to try it out. Really difficult to not put the remaining parts and electronics on credit cards now.
