[![](protostation.png)](protostation.png)

I should have built this 20 years ago. Slanty enclosure is from [Gateway Electronics](http://www.gatewaycatalog.com/) . Switching 5 & +/-12v power supply for now and plenty of space for switches/indicators and I-O recepticles. The voltmeter sitting on top is from [ABC Electronics](http://www.abcelectronicsmn.com/) and will be installed with a 0-30v LM317 based variable power supply.
