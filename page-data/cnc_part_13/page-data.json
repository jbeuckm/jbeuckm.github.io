One learns a lot of things quickly in the first few hours operating a router like this. Work has to be held down very firmly to produce the shape accurately. And a cable tray like the Dragon is very necessary to keep cables safely away from the bit and from being stretched across parts of the machine.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_13","title":"CNC Part 13","date":"2011-09-27","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<p>I inadvertently learned that this FLA-100 clone will cut steel when my 1/4\" carbide tool path intersected one of the 5/16\" washers I was using to hold down the work.

I jogged each axis end to and repeatedly to shift things into place, tightening a little each trip.
