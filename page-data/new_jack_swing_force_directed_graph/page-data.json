I've been taking some time lately to hone my sharpening skills and encountered the idea of building my own hand planes. It's a very attractive idea since good handplanes are anywhere from very to extremely expensive, and being able to make my own would allow me to build any variation of specialty plane I might want to try. Plus, my CNC router makes forming the basic shapes as easy as digitizing my idea into CAM software. I decided to build a large smoothing plane with a similar approach to the one in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJwXx9t5pE&#x26;list\">Mike's CNC Shop youtube video</a>. I prepared two planks of white oak a little less than 1.5\" thick and drew a basic shape into Cambam.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cnc_0-24621daf5d54a0c40d726e80175fbb5a.jpg\"><img src=\"/cnc_0-24621daf5d54a0c40d726e80175fbb5a.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>A closeup of the bed and abutment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cnc_detail_0-e49211434a51fd397a6f7e23a7d21c84.jpg\"><img src=\"/cnc_detail_0-e49211434a51fd397a6f7e23a7d21c84.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here are the two halves raw from the router.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/parts_0-d4f948ea7380150f1f62e8e2bebc4afb.jpg\"><img src=\"/parts_0-d4f948ea7380150f1f62e8e2bebc4afb.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>I tapered the abutments to full width at the mouth with hand chisels. I didn't chisel the tapers all the way to the full width at the top-front of the abutments but I'll widen each side with my drill press sander for finger access to the shavings. I clamped the halves together and drilled holes for two dowels that will keep the halves from sliding out of alignment while the glue dries. I tried to keep glue away from the bed but there was a significant amount of squeezeout which I mostly wiped away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/clamp_0-3aeca92651ec3be3890cad5f6e5a9e69.jpg\"><img src=\"/clamp_0-3aeca92651ec3be3890cad5f6e5a9e69.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here is a new 2\" iron of A2 tool steel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04264-d38ebbc58f85196be52c9d4b2853f9d7.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04264-d38ebbc58f85196be52c9d4b2853f9d7.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The blank for my wedge - rock maple</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04265-8408a21a48312c2df11b5d486488c08b.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04265-8408a21a48312c2df11b5d486488c08b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The high speed steel router bit was fairly dull by the time the mouth halves were cut.
