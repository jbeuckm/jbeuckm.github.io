The X-axis is aligned and slides easily and smoothly by hand. So I tightened down the acme nut and bearing blocks at each end and chucked an inch of 1/4\" rod in my drill to try it out. Really difficult to not put the remaining parts and electronics on credit cards now.</p>\n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/qUawRx7x16Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></iframe>","id":"c8e9eb4c-46cb-564d-856d-714e83f5da46","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_7","title":"CNC Part 7","date":"2011-06-01","tags":["cnc","video"],"hexagonImages":["Screen%20shot%202011-07-20%20at%2011.38.21%20PM.png_hexagon.png"]}},"next":{"html":"<p><a href=\"http://discountsteel.com\">DiscountSteel.com</a> had my rails cut and ready within 24 hours and I picked them up at lunch. Carefully scratched 32.7mm from the good edge with a woodscrew about every 4in. Then a tap with the transfer punch, check, and a good hit with the transfer punch. I drilled 1/8\" pilot holes and then 21/64\" for a close fit on the 5/16\" carriage bolts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\"><img src=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\" alt=\"img134\" title=\"img134\"></a> </p>\n<p>My rails are 2-1/2\" and hang inside a little. 20 minutes on the grinder per notch. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\"><img src=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\" alt=\"img1361\" title=\"img1361\"></a> </p>\n<p>They fit! This feels like real progress. The base is square and tight and the last metric vs. standard issue to correct will be the X-axis motor mount. Everything else (bearing blocks, acme nut) is referenced from the bottom surface of the 8020. I added a sideways length of my 40x80mm 80/20 between the front table side and the 14\" extension so that the front 1-1/2\" separated bearing block holes will fit. I sacrifice the lengthwise adjustment for that but can work out that difference with the grinder. All X and Y-aligned pieces will be a few millimeters longer than the plan due to the difference between 80mm and 3in. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\"><img src=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\" alt=\"img135\" title=\"img135\"></a> </p>","id":"7a61831b-9093-51fe-8994-4fda385d3c71","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_5","title":"CNC Part 5","date":"2011-05-21","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":["img134.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","img1361.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","img135.jpg_hexagon.jpeg"]}}}}}
