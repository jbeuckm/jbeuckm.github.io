(especially the raps and breakdowns) very frequently. Eagerly awaiting the next breakdown 1/14/03 and making myself late for work, I realized a need for a condensed version of Dance! ...Ya Know It! for times when complete songs are not the priority or our busy lifestyles just won't afford us the whole 47:29. I've been able to compile the major raps and breakdowns from Dance! ...Ya Know It! into 628 seconds available in the mp3 file that follows:</p>\n<p><audio src=\"/digest_ya_know_it-a57f5cf4c95c91e94f8f1953476dad90.mp3\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"auto\" autobuffer=\"autobuffer\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><source src=\"digest_ya_know_it.mp3\"></audio></p>","id":"dbf3a67d-6b10-59c7-b797-d59fc8df99fb","frontmatter":{"path":"/digest_____ya_know_it_","title":"Digest! ...Ya Know It!","date":"2003-01-14","tags":["bobby-brown","music"],"hexagonImages":["dsc03370.jpeg_hexagon.jpeg","dsc03370-300x225.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","dsc03370.jpg_hexagon.jpeg"]}}}}}
