They worked great but have mostly sat unused because PAiA ran out of the chips in their VCO kit and no VCO = very little fun. This spring I looked again and found a great DIY synth community on the internet. The ASM VCO #3 had parts I could find and seemed viable so I built up two of them: </p>\n<p><a href=\"/dual_vco3-1f2dab3518a23bf74bfdb5342cf9dde4.jpg\"><img src=\"/dual_vco3-1f2dab3518a23bf74bfdb5342cf9dde4.jpg\" title=\"dual_vco3\"></a> </p>\n<p>These were my first PCB etchings in a long time and first things that I mounted in the frac-rack. I had several trace-patches to do and calibrated these mostly by ear. The back side is a nightmare but they work great.
