I jogged each axis end to and repeatedly to shift things into place, tightening a little each trip. Things are looking pretty well square after building a sharpie holder and jogging in large rectangles. Here is an old javascript/easelJS drawing pattern I made, now adapted to output g-code. Router mount on the way. For now, I have an overly powerful plotter / sharpie ruiner.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_12","title":"CNC Part 12","date":"2011-09-18","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<p> <a href=\"/DSC04186-fc1f6c29722af549401613621da51846.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04186-fc1f6c29722af549401613621da51846.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04189-28bab7546619950330fc6054836e5807.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04189-28bab7546619950330fc6054836e5807.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04190_0-9b55e9634ec1381a5882e8805a757920.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04190_0-9b55e9634ec1381a5882e8805a757920.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04193-1c7363813fc1eb300ec067d84512ce85.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04193-1c7363813fc1eb300ec067d84512ce85.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>There is a great cable tray design shared online by Kronos Robotics at <a href=\"http://www.kronosrobotics.com/krmx01/krmx01upgrades/dragoncable/\">http://www.kronosrobotics.com/krmx01/krmx01upgrades/dragoncable/</a></p>\n<p>This made for a perfect \"first cuts\" project with my router. One learns a lot of things quickly in the first few hours operating a router like this. Work has to be held down very firmly to produce the shape accurately. And a cable tray like the Dragon is very necessary to keep cables safely away from the bit and from being stretched across parts of the machine.</p>","id":"3d725d50-494c-5589-b28b-207e7ff705f1","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_13","title":"CNC Part 13","date":"2011-09-27","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":["DSC04186.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04189.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04190_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04193.JPG_hexagon.jpeg"]}},"next":{"html":"<p> <a href=\"/DSC04171-11fb31cdb6b7eb5811c29bcbf7cd6219.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04171-11fb31cdb6b7eb5811c29bcbf7cd6219.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>I have been waiting for today a LONG time.
