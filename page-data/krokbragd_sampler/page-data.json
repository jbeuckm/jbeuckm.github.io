I have only used \"balanced\" tieups that lower and raise pairs of shafts together, though I have read that unbalanced tieups can be used with counterbalance looms.</p>\n<p>In order to use arbitrary tieups and maybe add a few shafts, I have been converting my loom to countermarche. The mechanism is kind of a neat thing to build, with pulleys and levers and a lot of control cords. I would like to try shaft-switching at some point, so I went with vertical jacks so that there is no lamm cord through the center of the shafts. Now that I have a lathe, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYQlXi776s\">this pulley method</a> is a good way to make them. Here they are still spinning:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/wheels_spinning-7a7aff532577991432a81962ee0ba2ae.jpg\" alt=\"wheels_spinning.jpg\"></p>\n<p>then with some danish oil...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/wheels-0ea08312a5d5c6e53e7e4c44d380d019.jpg\" alt=\"wheels.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I think my old Swedish Gesta Snikerifabrik is a very common floor loom design. Here are a few measurements I took to build additional lamms, jacks and shafts:</p>\n<p>Lamm: 5/8\" x 1-5/8\" x 57\"\nBetween left &#x26; right uprights (inside dimension): 1-1/2\"\nLeft/Right Upright Thickness: 1-1/2\"\nShaft rod: 7/16\" x 1-1/4\" x 55\"\nPulley: 1/2\" x 1-1/2\"</p>\n<p>Here is the new pulley holder with the first jack tied only to the first \"long lamm\". I made the jack the same dimensions as the lamms with 12\" between the axel and the shaft coords and another 12\" up to the lamm cord. This is a lot bigger than it needs to be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/first_jack-dee68886b1d4934c424d8be19d23f027.jpg\" alt=\"first_jack.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Here are the first two jacks in place, showing the pulleys from the lamm side.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/two_shafts_working-9aae77e4a16c78e78b3ed4f2832a9a6b.jpg\" alt=\"two_shafts_working.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I used 11\" instead of 12\" for the third jack, but it can probably be a lot smaller.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/three_shafts-c4d517bcee531caae8bf99b94c8d14c7.jpg\" alt=\"three_shafts.jpg\"></p>","id":"6ad040d3-5ca9-59b3-bf62-501f5088ccb4","frontmatter":{"path":"/countermarche","title":"Converting Counterbalance To Countermarche","date":"2022-05-15","tags":["weaving","wood"],"hexagonImages":["two_shafts_working_hexagon.jpg","wheels_hexagon.jpg","wheels_spinning_hexagon.jpg"]}}}}}
