Carefully scratched 32.7mm from the good edge with a woodscrew about every 4in. Then a tap with the transfer punch, check, and a good hit with the transfer punch. I drilled 1/8\" pilot holes and then 21/64\" for a close fit on the 5/16\" carriage bolts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\"><img src=\"/img134-e6ae2864ff1d9056fb827f7658d268a6.jpg\" alt=\"img134\" title=\"img134\"></a> </p>\n<p>My rails are 2-1/2\" and hang inside a little. 20 minutes on the grinder per notch. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\"><img src=\"/img1361-e92e601cd2596213d5ae225bf0b7398f.jpg\" alt=\"img1361\" title=\"img1361\"></a> </p>\n<p>They fit! This feels like real progress. The base is square and tight and the last metric vs. standard issue to correct will be the X-axis motor mount. Everything else (bearing blocks, acme nut) is referenced from the bottom surface of the 8020. I added a sideways length of my 40x80mm 80/20 between the front table side and the 14\" extension so that the front 1-1/2\" separated bearing block holes will fit. I sacrifice the lengthwise adjustment for that but can work out that difference with the grinder. All X and Y-aligned pieces will be a few millimeters longer than the plan due to the difference between 80mm and 3in. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\"><img src=\"/img135-9f1e57b4faab5e2798e26a1f4404a256.jpg\" alt=\"img135\" title=\"img135\"></a> </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_5","title":"CNC Part 5","date":"2011-05-21","tags":["CNC"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"html":"<p>CNC base in the place and a rudimentary little computer desk. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/img137-664dc9a92ef1ec756367ea40bb915c1e.jpg\"><img src=\"/img137-664dc9a92ef1ec756367ea40bb915c1e.jpg\" alt=\"img137\" title=\"img137\"></a> </p>","id":"d65bb66c-bd06-5625-b72e-5c338592198a","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_6","title":"CNC Part 6","date":"2011-05-24","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":["img137.jpeg_hexagon.jpeg","img137-300x225.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","img137.jpg_hexagon.jpeg"]}},"next":{"html":"<p>My first departure was a learning experience but is over. The cost of good motors and the gecko controller call for a machine with commensurate capabilities to be worthwhile. Fine Line Automation offers a popular kit called FLA-100 and posts free plans for the machine on their website. I decided to save for the entire kit and electronics. Then ABC Electronics got in a good load of 80/20 and my willpower gave out. A little at a time, my FLA-100 clone begins. <a href=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\"><img src=\"/dsc04081-e6c02ecaa8b4aae662bf0bc1c12efa62.jpg\" alt=\"dsc04081\" title=\"dsc04081\"></a></p>\n<p>This is a cheap sacrificial multipurpose blade.

I realized after buying that this 80/20 is metric 40mm-based instead of 1-1/2\" per the plan. I ordered 2-1/2\" 1018 rails from DiscountSteel.com to drill myself so that the overhang is 1/2\" for the carriages from CNCRouterParts.com. Luckily, everything else works out if I switch to 1-1/2\"-based 80/20 from the carriages on.</p>","id":"7fe0c2b9-ec5c-5f4a-a132-db6f6353413a","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_4","title":"CNC Part 4","date":"2011-05-18","tags":["CNC"],"hexagonImages":["dsc04081.jpeg_hexagon.jpeg","dsc04081.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","dsc04080.jpg_hexagon.jpeg","dsc04082.jpg_hexagon.jpeg"]}}}}}
