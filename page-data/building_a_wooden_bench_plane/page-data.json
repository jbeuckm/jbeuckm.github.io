I've been taking some time lately to hone my sharpening skills and encountered the idea of building my own hand planes. It's a very attractive idea since good handplanes are anywhere from very to extremely expensive, and being able to make my own would allow me to build any variation of specialty plane I might want to try. Plus, my CNC router makes forming the basic shapes as easy as digitizing my idea into CAM software. I decided to build a large smoothing plane with a similar approach to the one in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnJwXx9t5pE&#x26;list\">Mike's CNC Shop youtube video</a>. I prepared two planks of white oak a little less than 1.5\" thick and drew a basic shape into Cambam.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cnc_0-24621daf5d54a0c40d726e80175fbb5a.jpg\"><img src=\"/cnc_0-24621daf5d54a0c40d726e80175fbb5a.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>A closeup of the bed and abutment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cnc_detail_0-e49211434a51fd397a6f7e23a7d21c84.jpg\"><img src=\"/cnc_detail_0-e49211434a51fd397a6f7e23a7d21c84.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here are the two halves raw from the router.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/parts_0-d4f948ea7380150f1f62e8e2bebc4afb.jpg\"><img src=\"/parts_0-d4f948ea7380150f1f62e8e2bebc4afb.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>I tapered the abutments to full width at the mouth with hand chisels. I didn't chisel the tapers all the way to the full width at the top-front of the abutments but I'll widen each side with my drill press sander for finger access to the shavings. I clamped the halves together and drilled holes for two dowels that will keep the halves from sliding out of alignment while the glue dries. I tried to keep glue away from the bed but there was a significant amount of squeezeout which I mostly wiped away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/clamp_0-3aeca92651ec3be3890cad5f6e5a9e69.jpg\"><img src=\"/clamp_0-3aeca92651ec3be3890cad5f6e5a9e69.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Here is a new 2\" iron of A2 tool steel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04264-d38ebbc58f85196be52c9d4b2853f9d7.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04264-d38ebbc58f85196be52c9d4b2853f9d7.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The blank for my wedge - rock maple</p>\n<p><a href=\"/DSC04265-8408a21a48312c2df11b5d486488c08b.jpg\"><img src=\"/DSC04265-8408a21a48312c2df11b5d486488c08b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The high speed steel router bit was fairly dull by the time the mouth halves were cut.

To cut this pattern, the machine has to make thousands of movements staying within a few hundredths accurate. I tried cutting one for my parents' xmas present from some nice brazilian cherry. I joined two planks to get the required 16\" width, flattened the top and sprayed a light coat of polyurethane to help avoid chipping during the lighter detail passes. Next time I would apply a thick layer of poly since a few detailed places show some chipping.</p>\n<p>These were taken about an hour in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04195_0-99f66e6bac911dd6e235e3c4debbd724.jpg\"> <img src=\"/DSC04197_0-d3138a0fcd644121e91e0ad4b88d5675.jpg\"> <img src=\"/DSC04198_0-7b8b0646537399a24cdc55ddb82987ba.jpg\"></p>\n<p>lots of burrs to clean up by hand...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04199_0-3f0ed244a04701c3079f185398f0799f.jpg\"></p>\n<p>around two hours...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04202_0-9724e1142a5bbc1945192557d1dc96a5.jpg\"></p>\n<p>It took about three hours but came out very well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04204-59ef014a333a3a33d60a69f621c4269b.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I carefully added a circle about 1/4\" outside the pattern to cut the calendar from the stock.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04208_0-7f34c87032b9daa968283a1e494e684a.jpg\"></p>\n<p>ready for cleanup and a few light coats of poly</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSC04212_0-e87c2bb6a348f926778fd916422f85cf.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I think they liked it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/DSCN7390-0ba2fce49776c6ba458c47652d38f7be.jpeg\"></p>","id":"daf8ead2-8eef-519e-b7d2-e3b8ff796080","frontmatter":{"path":"/cnc_part_15_aztec_calendar","title":"CNC Part 15: Aztec Calendar","date":"2012-01-01","tags":["CNC","wood"],"hexagonImages":["DSC04205.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04195_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04197_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04198_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04199_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04202_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04204.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04208_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSC04212_0.JPG_hexagon.jpeg","DSCN7390.jpeg_hexagon.jpeg"]}}}}}
