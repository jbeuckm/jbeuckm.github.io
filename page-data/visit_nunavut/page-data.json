The idea is to play back lots of little pieces (grains) of a sound at various times to create a new sound. In this demo, grain playback is accomplished by maintaining a list of GrainDescription objects which store where in the sample the grain started and how much has been played. Then for each sample of output, iterate through the list of grains and add the value of the original sound at each active grainâ€™s current position marker. Grains are added at a given interval and removed when they have played a given amount of time.</p>\n<input type=\"button\" onclick=\"javascript:document.getElementById('granular-swf').start();\" value=\"play\">\n<object id=\"granular-swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"  width=\"634\" height=\"355\">\n  <param name=\"movie\" value=\"/Granular-7acbd29158cba4e2690cdef335a30aa6.swf\" />\n</object>\n<p>This element requires Flash 10.</p>\n<p>This demo provides controls for how fast to move through the sound spawning new grains, how fast to play the grains (pitch), how many samples long each grain should be (length) and how many samples to wait between starting new grains (interval). The green waveform shows the shape of the complete sample. The blue waveform is the shape of the envelope used to scale the amplitude of a grain over its lifetime. This grain envelope shape is the function sin(x)*sin(x) where x runs between zero and pi. Individual grains fade in and out smoothly to avoid the transients (clicks and pops) that would occur if short chops of audio were played directly.</p>\n<p>enjoy <a href=\"/Granular-e8bfcd212de5ba43390f41917ae6f2d0.zip\">source code</a></p>","id":"20f4d8d5-bd76-5a5b-8978-cc66dac82458","frontmatter":{"path":"/granular_synthesis_in_flash","title":"Granular Synthesis in Flash","date":"2010-06-30","tags":["flash","music","programming"],"hexagonImages":["default_hexagon.png"]}},"next":{"html":"<p><a href=\"/protostation-73ffcc1548519cd295ed0596ce920aa0.png\"><img src=\"/protostation-73ffcc1548519cd295ed0596ce920aa0.png\"></a></p>\n<p>I should have built this 20 years ago.
